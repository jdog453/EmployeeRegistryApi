Assessment for Royal Caribbean Job Opportunity

Here is my submission for the Front End Developer Position Project Assessment

I set up my visual studio to run both projects in the solution at the same time so everything could communicate correctly.

I did this by selecting the startup project and selecting mutliple.

If the save button on the insert and edit modals for the employee information doesn't let you submit, try deleting a number or letter in the Personal ID or email respectively. It should allow the save button to be enabled.
